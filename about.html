  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Our Story</h3>
  <p>Why the name Konjoe? To start, the founder’s name is Joey and in Japanese, the word “konjou” means daring and adventurous and at Konjoe, we like to think our food is just that. Our food pushes the envelope in the food industry as we hope to bring Asian and Pacific Island inspired flavors in various forms while using high-quality local ingredients.

Joey Camacho has always had a passion for food and cooking. Having grown up in Guam and being exposed to various flavors of Asia at a young age, he knew he would one day own a restaurant of his own.

He received his bachelor’s degree and MBA from Santa Clara University and studied culinary arts at the Professional Culinary Institute. With both business and culinary backgrounds, Joey united these two foundations to start Konjoe. He’s worked at various restaurants in Guam, Hawaii and California. His culinary style is defined as New American with influences from Asia and the Pacific Islands.
